Transmute is a top code/technical contributor at DIF and has been deeply involved in work on interoperability and scalable identifiers - most notably the Sidetree Protocol work. Karyl has served a 2 year term on the DIF Steering Committee, representing the small business membership demographic and successfully advocating for initiatives that secure DIF’s long-term viability by ensuring the technologies we standardize and incubate together find real world use and commercial homes. Examples include collaborating with DIF leaders to upgrade DIF governance practices, including transparent elections and a more diverse SC, driving attention to prioritize commercial engagement (e.g. more enterprise membership/sponsorship) in the SC Strategic Plans, and leading the effort to further define the requirements for a “DIF Ratified Specification.”</i>
                        <i>Karyl has directed strategic marketing and commercialization initiatives for startups in the biotechnology and semiconductor fields where cooperative standards initiatives played a critical role in creating competitive markets. Her experience centers on emerging tech in fields with high regulatory burdens like FDA, HIPAA and ITAR. Karyl’s interests include quantified self, data rights, and democratization especially as it pertains to genetics, and ensuring privacy-by-design at every level. She holds an MS in Technology Commercialization from McCombs Business School at the University of Texas and a BA in English and Political Science from Southwestern University.</i>

                        Kaliya Young  also known as Identity Woman founded the Internet Identity Workshop in 2005 and dedicated her career to the development of user-centric identity tools and technologies. She was at the founding meeting of DIF and has been active in working groups since its inception. She co-chairs the DIF Interoperability Working Group and Co-chair the Secure Data Store working group jointly chartered with CCG.  She curates a weekly newsletter summary of all the activities going on in SSI.

                        I'm running for the steering committee because I believe that DIF needs strong strategic leadership as the industry matures. DIF must work collaboratively with its neighbors, W3C CCG, W3C Working Groups, Trust over IP, OpenID Foundation, ID2020 and others. DIF needs to build relationships with civil society organizations and technology rights organizations whose opinions about emerging technology can influence decision makers' opinions and frame new technology opportunities and dangers for the public that adopts them. If clear strategic messaging is not developed in the next year there is a real danger the technologies we have worked so hard to develop will not get adopted because of fear based conspiracy theories.
