            <p>DIF was established to represent our fast changing community and to create a safe space for the co-development of next-generation code and specifications. From the original handful of members 5 years ago, the foundation has grown to become an organization with over 300 member companies, representing thousands of PRs and a strong commitment to decentralizing identity software.
            </p>
            <p>Since its inception, DIF has been primarily governed by a Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is an elected group of member representatives whom lead DIF, set strategy, assure the high quality of ratified work items, react to the communityâ€™s needs, among other decisions.
            Elections occur each year to ensure not only a democratic process to lead and administer DIF, but to continually provide a diverse and inclusive mix of commitee members, representative of the fabric of DIF's community.
